# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge
We as members, contributors, and maintainers pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people.
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
- Focusing on what is best for the community.
- Showing up with patience, understanding, and a willingness to help others.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances.
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment of any community member.
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Enforcement Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that violates this Code of Conduct.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Reporting Guidelines
If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please report it by contacting our Code of Conduct team at [email protected]. All reports will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces maintained by the project, including GitHub repositories, issue trackers, mailing lists, chat rooms, and in-person or virtual events.

## Enforcement
Incidents of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at [email protected]. Reports may be made anonymously.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
