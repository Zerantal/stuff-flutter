# stuff - Open Source Inventory Management App

## Project Overview

Got it üëç ‚Äî here‚Äôs a refined **project overview** that covers both the free offline scope and the future cloud-enabled version:

**Stuff** is a household inventory management app built with Flutter.
Its primary aim is to help individuals and families **organize possessions across locations, rooms, containers, and items**, complete with photos and descriptions.

* **Free personal use**: Always available as a fully offline version with **local storage only**. No accounts, no advertising, and no data leaving your device.
* **Future scope**: An optional cloud-enabled edition designed for **multi-user collaboration** (e.g., households, small teams), enabling shared access and management across devices.

By balancing simplicity and privacy in the offline edition with collaborative features in the cloud edition, Stuff is designed to be flexible enough for both personal and shared use.
